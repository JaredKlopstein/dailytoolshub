# dailytoolshub
 A growing collection of free, simple online tools built and released daily. From calculators to generators, this project is a personal challenge to create one new utility every day, hosted at dailytoolshub.com. Each tool is lightweight, SEO-optimized, and tracked with analytics to explore user engagement and growth.   Goal: Learn web development, experiment with SEO, and build a useful resource.    Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with plans to expand as needed).    Features: New tool daily, responsive design, Google Analytics integration.    Started: April 2025 with "Random Decision Maker."  Open to feedbackâ€”fork, star, or follow along as the hub evolves!
